//ANSWER:


        1 => Array(50) is operator which creates an array of object with size 50.
        2 =>  with .keys() method we get all the keys assigned to those 50 elements
        3 => [...Array(50).keys] we spread the keys inside an array , they start from 0 to 49
        4 =>  we map throgh this array and add 1 to eeach element

//IMPORTANT 
                THIS RANGE METHOD IS ADAVNCE BECAUSE 
                IT WORKS WITH LESS CODE AND
                CAN BUILD RANGE WHEN IF THE START AND END POINT ARE DIFFERNT 
                , FOR EG RANGEADV(20, 5) HERE WE GET 20 21 22 23 . 
                THUS IT IS MORE VERSATILE
