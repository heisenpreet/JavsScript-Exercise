//ANSWER    


                :This function can take any number of values , either array , objects or random variables

//           first we map through the passing iteams and assign a random key to evry item and store them as an array of objects in which each object has a random key and value which is equal to that of the mapped item

//         in second step of chaining we sort these array objects accoriding to their key

//       lastly we map a the sorted array with only the values , values which were our items to shuffle 


//      the random fx and sort() does the shuffling here
